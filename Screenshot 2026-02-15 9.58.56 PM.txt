CATALOGUE CARDS (bottom) for the Yale Medical Library are produced by computer
after initial key punching of cards (top), which contain information from a cataloguer's work
sheet. In producing the set of 11 cards the key punch operator enters only the information
typed at the left. The identification data at the right has to be punched only once, then is
duplicated automatically. The sequence of five catalogue cards is one of six sets printed by
computer. The other five sets, which are all alike, go to Yale's main catalogue and to several
other libraries. The sixth set shown here differs from the other five in that it consists of one
main entry card followed by four cards with heading lines ("tracings"), which are indexed
alphabetically in various parts of the main catalogue of the Yale Medical Library. The
various "tracing" cards are produced automatically according to programmed instructions.
